# Space-Shuttle-Orbiter-NASA-Project
In this project, I’m creating a detailed 3D model of NASA’s Space Shuttle Orbiter. The goal is to make it as realistic and accurate as possible just like the real NASA design.

You can use this 3D scientific model for educational purposes, experiment with it in your favorite game engine, or even bring it to life with the soul of a real space shuttle!
It took nearly 68 hours to create, starting with gathering accurate NASA references and capturing the full details of the shuttle. The model’s topology is especially complex at the front, and the most challenging part was the wings, which have a unique aerodynamic design.

How did I create it?
Well, the project wasn’t easy. I faced many challenging issues to make it happen, because it’s not just an art project—it combines technical aspects and precise geometry that matches reality. Every single aerodynamic part of the shuttle must be functional, not just a static shape, from the rudders to the elevators.

It’s not perfect yet—it still needs a working payload bay and landing gears—but here’s the exciting part: you can add those functionalities yourself! You can innovate even more than I did, completing what I started and taking it further.

Steps to Create the Space Shuttle

Phase 1 – Fuselage (Body)
I started with a cylinder, the most accurate base shape for the shuttle. I extruded each edge and carefully matched it to NASA references.
Time spent: ~12 hours

Phase 2 – Wings
Started with a cube, then extruded and aligned each part on the X, Y, and Z axes to match the real aerodynamic shape.
Time spent: ~10 hours

Phase 3 – Tail
Modeled the vertical and horizontal tail surfaces to match the shuttle’s real design.
Time spent: ~4 hours

Phase 4 – Rudders
Created functional rudders with correct proportions and placement.
Time spent: ~2 hours

Phase 5 – Ailerons & Elevators
Modeled the control surfaces on the wings and tail, paying attention to realistic aerodynamic functionality.
Time spent: ~3 hours

Phase 6 – Cockpit Windows
Used Boolean modifiers to accurately cut the cockpit windows.
Time spent: ~3 hours

Phase 7 – Side Windows
Added the side windows along the fuselage.
Time spent: ~1 hour

Phase 8 – Main Three Engines
Modeled the primary engines at the shuttle’s rear, including nozzles and detailing.
Time spent: ~5 hours

Phase 9 – Orbital Maneuvering Engines
Added the two smaller engines on the left and right for orbit adjustments.
Time spent: ~2 hours

Phase 10 – Simple Texturing & Materials
Applied basic metallic textures to give the shuttle a realistic surface.
Time spent: ~3 hours

Phase 11 – Fuel Tank
Created the cylindrical external fuel tank that powers the main engines to reach low Earth orbit.
Time spent: ~4 hours

Phase 12 – Solid Fuel Boosters
Modeled the two boosters that provide most of the thrust to reach mid-orbit.
Time spent: ~3 hours

Phase 13 – Booster Connectors
Added the structural connectors between the solid fuel boosters and the fuel tank.
Time spent: ~1 hour

Phase 14 – Fuel Tank Connectors
Connected the fuel tank to the shuttle body accurately.
Time spent: ~1 hour

Total estimated time: ~55–60 hours

How to Export and Use in Your Game Engine

Select the model in your 3D software (e.g., Blender).

Check the scale and orientation to match your engine’s requirements.

Apply all transforms (rotation, scale, location) before exporting.

Export as FBX or glTF (preferred for Unreal Engine, Unity, or other engines).

Import into your engine and assign materials/textures.

Optional: Set up pivot points for moving parts like rudders, ailerons, or payload bay doors.

You can now animate or interact with your shuttle inside your engine!
